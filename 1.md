### **API Requirements**

#### **1. Requirement to Query Data with Low Latency**
- This API must provide search results based on client-defined criteria with minimal delay.
- Results must be fetched directly from Cosmos DB for low-latency performance.

#### **2. Requirement to Query Bulk Data**
- This API supports fetching large datasets (e.g., millions of records) where higher latency is acceptable.
- Queries are executed against a Delta table in Azure Data Lake using **JDBC connectivity via Databricks SQL Warehouse**.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **For Low Latency API:**
- Allow querying based on specific filters (e.g., attributes, date range).
- Return results within a few seconds (target: < 1 second).
- Support real-time consistency in data retrieval.

#### **For Bulk Data API:**
- Allow querying large datasets using filters.
- Deliver results asynchronously with a mechanism for polling and pre-signed URL retrieval.
- Results must be retrieved using **JDBC from Databricks SQL Warehouse**.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **For Low Latency API:**
- **Scalability:** Must handle concurrent requests without significant performance degradation.
- **Availability:** Ensure uptime of 99.9% or higher.
- **Security:** Enforce authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and HTTPS for data in transit.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize Cosmos DB usage to minimize request unit (RU) costs.

#### **For Bulk Data API:**
- **Scalability:** Support multiple simultaneous bulk queries.
- **Reliability:** Ensure data consistency between Cosmos DB and Delta Lake.
- **Security:** Use expirable pre-signed URLs for secure data access.
- **Performance:** Optimize performance of Databricks SQL Warehouse queries via indexing, partitioning, and caching.

### **Comparison of Two Approaches for Bulk Data Retrieval**

#### **Option 1: Clients Connect Directly to SQL Warehouse via JDBC**

- **Pros:**
  - Clients can execute queries directly without relying on an API.
  - No additional API development or maintenance is required.
  - Full flexibility in querying different tables, schemas, and aggregations.
  - Direct access may reduce query latency if the client is optimized.
  - Lower infrastructure cost as no additional API layer is required.

- **Cons & Remediations:**
  1. **Schema Changes Impact Clients** → Use **views** to abstract underlying table changes.
  2. **Security Concerns** (Direct DB access for multiple clients) → Use **restricted access control** with token-based authentication.
  3. **Performance Impact of Unoptimized Queries** → Enforce **query optimization policies** or provide pre-optimized views.
  4. **Harder to Implement Usage Monitoring** → Implement **query logging in Databricks**.
  5. **Clients Need JDBC Drivers and Configuration** → Provide **pre-configured connection templates**.

---

#### **Option 2: A Custom API Layer Using JDBC to Connect to SQL Warehouse**

- **Pros:**
  - **Shields clients from schema changes** by abstracting underlying table modifications.
  - **Allows enforcement of query constraints** to optimize performance.
  - **Provides a unified authentication and authorization layer.**
  - **Can log and monitor queries centrally** for auditing and cost management.
  - **Supports additional features such as result caching** to improve performance.

- **Cons & Remediations:**
  1. **Higher Development & Maintenance Effort** → Use **auto-generated API frameworks (e.g., OpenAPI)** to simplify API updates.
  2. **Potential API Bottleneck for Large Queries** → Implement **pagination and batch processing** for bulk data retrieval.
  3. **Additional Infrastructure Costs** → Optimize **serverless deployment (Azure Functions, Kubernetes, etc.)** to scale as needed.
  4. **Adds Latency Compared to Direct JDBC Access** → Implement **result caching at the API level** to reduce repeated query loads.
  5. **Clients Have Limited Query Flexibility** → Expose a **query builder in the API** to allow controlled query execution.

### **Comparison Table: Direct JDBC vs. API-Based Approach**

| Feature                          | Direct JDBC Access to SQL Warehouse | API Layer with JDBC Connectivity |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Query Flexibility**            | High - Clients can execute any query | Medium - API defines available queries |
| **Performance**                   | Direct DB access, low overhead | Slightly higher latency due to API layer |
| **Security**                       | Requires careful client access control | API enforces centralized authentication |
| **Schema Change Management**       | Clients affected by schema changes | API abstracts schema changes for clients |
| **Monitoring & Logging**           | Hard to track per-client usage | API logs and monitors queries centrally |
| **Development Effort**             | None | Requires API development and maintenance |
| **Infrastructure Cost**            | Lower (only Databricks SQL Warehouse) | Higher (API hosting and Databricks cost) |
| **Scalability**                    | High, but risks inefficient queries | API enforces query optimizations |
| **Query Performance Optimization** | Clients responsible for optimization | API can enforce optimized queries |
| **Integration Complexity**         | Clients need JDBC driver setup | API simplifies client integration |

---

### **Final Recommendation**

- If the clients are **internal users (e.g., analysts, data scientists)** who need full query flexibility, **Direct JDBC access** is a suitable choice.
- If the clients are **external applications or business users** who need a structured, reliable interface, an **API-based approach** is preferable.
- For **high-volume bulk queries**, an **API should support pagination and caching** to mitigate performance issues.
- **Schema evolution should be handled using views** to ensure backward compatibility in both approaches.

**Hybrid Approach:** 
- Provide **Direct JDBC access for power users** (e.g., internal teams, analysts).
- Expose an **API for structured, controlled access** to protect external clients from schema changes and enforce security.
